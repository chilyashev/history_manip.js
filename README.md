# history_manip.js
Small javascript library for cathing back forward and refresh browser actions.

Just include the .js file in your html and you get access to the onBack, onForward, onRefresh and onUnknownAction events. Alternatively you can (and should) check out the examples. They can't be any simpler.

*Disclaimer #1:*
I *do* realize that what this library is doing is a very bad practice and should not be done. However I really do *not* care. So that's that. If you feel the same knock yourself out.

*Disclaimer #2:*
There *are* some situations in which it doesn't work quite properly. It's a work in progress. I will, at some point, improve on it. Possibly. Either way feel free to fork and use at your leasure.
